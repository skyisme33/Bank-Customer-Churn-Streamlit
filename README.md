# Bank Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction using Streamlit

## Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the most critical challenges faced by banks and financial institutions. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to identify patterns that lead to customer churn and predicting whether a customer is likely to leave the bank.

The project is developed as an **interactive web application using Streamlit**, which allows users to explore data insights, visualize churn risk, and perform predictions using a trained machine learning model.

## Objectives of the Project
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze bank customer data and understand churn behavior
- To build a machine learning model for churn prediction
- To present insights through an interactive dashboard
- To assist banks in identifying high-risk customers
- To support data-driven decision making for customer retention

---

## Problem Statement
Banks lose a significant number of customers every year due to dissatisfaction, competition, or lack of engagement. The challenge is to identify **which customers are likely to churn** before they leave, so that preventive actions can be taken.

This project aims to solve this problem by:
- Analyzing customer attributes
- Identifying important churn factors
- Predicting churn probability using machine learning

## Scope of the Project
- Suitable for banking and financial institutions
- Can be extended to other subscription-based industries
- Supports batch prediction using uploaded datasets
- Can be enhanced with real-time data and advanced models
